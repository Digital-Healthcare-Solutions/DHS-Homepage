                                benefit that allows you to bill for the time you

                                your patients, their care plans, and their
                                appointments. We also provide a way for you to

                                There are several ways to integrate our call
                                center with your practice. You can simply just
                                copy and paste the new number we provide you
                                into your google buisness account and it will
                                automatically forward calls to us. You could
                                also forward calls to us via your existing phone
                                system if it is SIP enabled. We can also assist
                                you in setting up a BYOC (Bring Your Own
                                Carrier) account with us. This is a great option
                                for practices that want to keep their existing
                                phone number and have the ability to forward
                                calls to us without having to change their
                                existing system.
